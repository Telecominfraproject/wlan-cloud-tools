# wlan-cloud-tools
OpenWiFi Community tools used with Cloud 2.x SDK  

# Overview
This repository shows how to build a microservice that can be part of the OpenWifi eco-system, leveraging security, logging, Kafka intehration, etc.

# Philosophy
The whole eco-system must be API driven. We have chosen OpenAPI 3.0 as the standard to express inter-service exchanges. This guarantees language agnostic
architecture.
